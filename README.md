# R package ref2014

An R package to simplify downloading and analysing 2014 REF results.

Only really intended for my personal use, but might be handy for others, too.

## Installation

This package is still in development, but you can install the latest version with
``` r
devtools::install_github('Selbosh/ref2014')
```

## Example

Download all REF results and submissions for every unit of assessment from the
[REF 2014 web site](https://www.ref.ac.uk/2014/).
``` r
download_uoa()
```
You need only run this once.
